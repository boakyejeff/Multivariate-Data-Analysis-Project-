# Multivariate-Data-Analysis-Project-
This project in R analyzes housing data from Boston , applying multivariate statistical techniques to uncover relationships between house prices (`MEDV`) and various features such as crime rate (`CRIM`), number of rooms (`RM`), and tax rate (`TAX`).  

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes **housing data from Boston**, applying **multivariate statistical techniques** to uncover relationships between house prices (`MEDV`) and various features such as crime rate (`CRIM`), number of rooms (`RM`), and tax rate (`TAX`).  

## Key Techniques Used 🛠  
✔️ Summary statistics & visualization  
✔️ Correlation analysis & scatter plots    
✔️ Multiple Linear Regression Models  
✔️ Feature selection based on significance  

## Dataset 📊  
- **Boston Housing Dataset** (506 records, 14 features)  - not shared
- Used for exploring factors influencing median home values (`MEDV`).  

## Key Insights 📌  
- `RM` (average rooms per dwelling) has the **strongest positive correlation** with house prices.  
- `LSTAT` (percentage of lower status population) and `TAX` negatively impact `MEDV`.  
- A **full regression model** explains **77.8% of the variance**, while a **feature-selected model** achieves **72.9%** accuracy.
